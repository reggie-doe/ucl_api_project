🏫 UCL Secure API Gateway

The UCL Secure API Gateway is a proof-of-concept project exploring secure API design, authentication mechanisms, and access control patterns in academic systems.
It was built to demonstrate best practices for managing sensitive data — such as student profiles, course information, and research resources — via a unified API interface.


🔒 Overview

Modern web systems rely heavily on APIs, and universities are no exception.
This project investigates how to protect institutional APIs through layered security controls including:

Authentication via OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Role-based access control (RBAC) for internal and external users

Request rate limiting and API key management

Secure transmission (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+) and strict CORS policies

Audit logging, security monitoring, and incident response procedures

The main objective is to provide an educational reference for students at University College London learning about application security and privacy-preserving architectures.

📊 Logging & Monitoring

Every request is logged with:

timestamp

HTTP method and route

status code

user ID (if available)

latency (ms)

Logs are shipped to Splunk/SIEM for correlation and alerting.
