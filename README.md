🏫 UCL Secure API Gateway

The UCL Secure API Gateway is a proof-of-concept project exploring secure API design, authentication mechanisms, and access control patterns in academic systems.
It was built to demonstrate best practices for managing sensitive data — such as student profiles, course information, and research resources — via a unified API interface.
